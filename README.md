# Healthcare Chatbot Project

## Overview
The Healthcare Chatbot leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to provide preliminary symptom assessment and health recommendations. The objective is to improve healthcare accessibility by enabling users to receive automated responses from natural-language symptom descriptions.

---

## System Architecture
The system follows a three-tier architecture:
- Presentation Layer
- Business Logic Layer
- Data Access Layer

Workflow:  
User enters symptoms → text is processed → ML model predicts a condition → chatbot returns relevant advice.

## Core Modules (Functional Requirements)

### 1. User Interaction Module
- Conversational interface for collecting user input  
- Input validation  
- Session management  

### 2. Symptom Analysis and Classification Module
- Text preprocessing (tokenization)
- Feature extraction using CountVectorizer
- Prediction using a Naive Bayes classifier (MultinomialNB)

### 3. Feedback and Health Guidance Module
- Provides personalized health guidance based on predicted conditions
- Generates health recommendations
- Maintains user interaction history

## Implementation Details
The project is implemented using Python and machine learning libraries.

## System Components
- User Interface Layer (CLI or web-based interface)
- Chatbot Core (conversation flow and session management)
- NLP Module (text preprocessing, tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, feature extraction)
- ML Model Inference Layer (prediction using the trained classifier)
- Knowledge Base and Database (user profiles, symptoms, health conditions, recommendations, interaction history)

## Code Analysis and Execution Example
The implementation is demonstrated in the notebook:  
`MANISH AIML VITYARTHI PROJECT.ipynb`

Example dataset used during training:

| Symptom Input               | Condition Label     |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| fever and cough             | Common Cold         |
| headache and nausea         | Migraine            |
| chest pain                  | Heart Problem       |
| sore throat and fever       | Flu                 |
| joint pain and swelling     | Arthritis           |

The `CountVectorizer` and trained `MultinomialNB` classifier are saved using `pickle` as:
- `symptom_vec.pkl`
- `symptom_clf.pkl`

Example execution flow:
1. User enters: `fever and cough`
2. Input is transformed using the trained CountVectorizer
3. Model predicts: `Common Cold`
4. Chatbot response: `It seems like you might have a common cold. Rest and drink fluids.`

## Future Enhancements
- Deep learning-based models such as RNN or BERT for improved accuracy
- Cloud deployment to support scalability and high concurrent usage
- Compliance with medical regulations (HIPAA, GDPR)
- Ethical AI mechanisms including bias detection and explainability

---

## Performance and Metrics
- Target accuracy on test data: 85–90%
- Evaluation metrics include Precision, Recall, and F1-Score in addition to accuracy
- Response time goal: under 2 seconds per query
